# Day 07 – Ultrasonic Sensor with Servo Motor (Obstacle Avoidance)

## Objective

Control a servo motor based on distance measurements using an ultrasonic sensor.

## Components

- Arduino
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Servo Motor
- Jumper Wires

## Behavior

- Distance < 20 cm → Servo turns to avoid obstacle
- Distance ≥ 20 cm → Servo stays centered

## Skills Learned

- Servo motor control using PWM
- Sensor-actuator integration
- Basic obstacle avoidance logic
