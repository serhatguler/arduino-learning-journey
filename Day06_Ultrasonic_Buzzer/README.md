Day 06 – Ultrasonic Sensor with Buzzer Warning System

## Objective

Create a distance-based warning system using an ultrasonic sensor and buzzer.

## Components

- Arduino
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Passive Buzzer
- Jumper Wires

## Behavior

- Distance < 10 cm → High frequency buzzer
- Distance < 20 cm → Medium frequency buzzer
- Distance ≥ 20 cm → Silent

## Skills Learned

- Multi-level conditional logic
- tone() and noTone() usage
- Real-time sensor-based feedback
