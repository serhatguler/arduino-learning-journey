# Day 08 – Servo Scanning Obstacle Avoidance

## Objective

Implement a scanning algorithm using a servo motor and ultrasonic sensor to decide the safest direction.

## Behavior

- Servo scans left and right
- Measures distance at each angle
- Chooses direction with greater distance

## Skills Learned

- Decision algorithms
- Servo scanning logic
- Robotics perception basics
