# Day 05 – Ultrasonic Sensor with LED Control

## Objective

Measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor and control an LED based on the distance.

## Components

- Arduino
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- LED
- 220Ω Resistor
- Jumper Wires

## Logic

- If distance < 20 cm → LED ON
- Else → LED OFF

## Skills Learned

- Ultrasonic distance measurement
- Conditional logic (if/else)
- Digital output control
