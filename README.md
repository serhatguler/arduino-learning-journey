## What This Repository Contains
A series of progressively structured embedded systems projects, including:

- Digital and analog I/O
- Button handling with debouncing
- PWM and motor control
- Non-blocking timing using millis()
- Basic state machines
- Sensor and actuator integration

Each project includes:
- Clean, readable Arduino code
- A dedicated README explaining objectives and concepts
- Incremental complexity to reflect real learning progression
