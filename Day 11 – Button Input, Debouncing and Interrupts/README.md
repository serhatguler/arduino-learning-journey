# Day 11 – Button Input, Debouncing and Interrupts

## Objective

Implement reliable button input handling using both polling and hardware interrupts.

## Projects

1. Button polling with software debouncing
2. Button control using external interrupt

## Concepts Covered

- Button bounce and debouncing
- INPUT_PULLUP configuration
- Polling vs interrupt
- Interrupt Service Routines (ISR)

## Skills Learned

- Reliable human input handling
- Embedded interrupt usage
- Real-time event-driven programming
